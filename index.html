<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hello, welcome to my page! <br>
    During my time at UC Irvine, I focused on structural biology through an understanding of P450cam, a heme protein, through protein expression, purifications, X-ray crystallography, and enzymatic assays. I utilize Python in my research in analyzing data and running molecular dynamics free energy simulation for NOS, another heme protein. I'm also learning ML through side projects that utilize speech-to-text Vietnamese models through machine learning (Tensorflow). I enjoy learning new programs such as Swift for app development and Phenix for X-ray processing. In the near future, I want to explore more computation chemistry, with a focus on characterizing protein folding, structure, and drug interactions. ) </p>

<hr/>

<h2>Research Experiences</h2>
<h4>University of California, Irvine, Department of Chemistry, Advisors: Thomas L. Poulos, David Mobley <br/>
    Graduate Research, 2018 - 2023 </h4>
<p> My research focuses on structural biology from an understanding of P450cam, a heme protein, through protein expression, purifications, X-ray crystallography, and enzymatic assays. 
    I ran molecular dynamics free energy simulation for NOS, another heme protein, with Amber18 and wrote scripts to calculate Linear Interactive Free Energy. 
     </p>

<h4>University of Texas at Austin, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Advisors: Dawit Kidane <br/>
    Undergraduate Research, 2016 -2017  </h4>
<p> I analyze databases of cancer patients to look for NIEL3 expression as a marker for high-risk cancer as
    well as performing site-directed mutagenesis to replicate noted mutations prevalent in ovarian cancer.     
        </p>

<h4>
    Cornell University, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Siu Sylvia Lee Ph.D. <br/>
    Undergraduate Research Assistant Summer Internship, 2017
</h4>
<p> I ran motility assays for the Poly-Q C. elegans model of Huntington's disease. 
    I also analyzed motility through tracking software in ImageJ developed through python.
    </p>
<h4> Johns Hopkins University, Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Diane E. Griffin, M.D. Ph.D.  <br/> 
    Undergraduate Research Assistant Summer Internship, 2016</h4>
<p>I perform Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) on parafilm-embedded brain slices of directed mice who were antibodies deficient and were Induced with viral encephalitis through the alphavirus Sindbis (SINV) TE strand and tracked the TE viral clearance following the transcranial infection. </p>

<h4>University of Texas at Austin, Freshman Research Initiative, Gwen Stovall Ph.D. <br/>
    Undergraduate Research, 2015 - 2016<br/>
    Freshman Research Initiative: Aptamer stream. </h4>
<p>I narrow down tight-binding aptamers through multiple rounds of SELEX methods that consist of Bead-based selection, Ethanol precipitation, Reverse Transcription, PCR, Transcription, PAGE purification, bacterial culturing, and DNA sequencing. </p>

<h2>Work Experiences</h2>
<H4>Harmonic Discovery, New York, NY, CEO: Rayees Rahman, Advisor: Francesco Trozzi  <br/>
     Internship and Consulting, 2023 - current.</h4>
<p>I utilize ColabFold to steer structure prediction of different kinase conformation and wrote scripts to investigate intermolecular similarities between benchmark versus predicted kinases. The variety of kinase conformation will implement future understanding of Poly-Pharmacology in drug discovery. </p>
